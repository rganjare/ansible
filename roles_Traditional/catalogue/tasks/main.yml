# 2. Let's now set up the catalogue application.
# As part of operating system standards, we run all the applications and databases as a normal user but not with root user.
# So to run the catalogue service we choose to run as a normal user and that user name should be more relevant to the project. 
# Hence we will use `roboshop` as the username to run the service.
# # useradd roboshop
